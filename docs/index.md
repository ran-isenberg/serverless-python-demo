## **The Pragmatic Python Serverless Developer**

## **The Problem**

Starting a Serverless service can be overwhelming. You need to figure out many questions and challenges that have nothing to do with your business domain:

- How to deploy to the cloud? What IAC framework do you choose?
- How to write a SaaS-oriented CI/CD pipeline? What does it need to contain?
- How do you write a Lambda function?
- How do you handle observability, logging, tracing, metrics?
- How do you handle testing?

## **The Solution**

This project provides a serverless service which is based an opinionated approach to Python project setup, testing, profiling, deployments, and operations.
Learn about many open source tools, including Powertools for AWS Lambdaâ€”a toolkit that can help you implement serverless best practices and increase developer velocity.

### **Serverless Template**

The service we present here started from the [AWS Lambda Handler Cookbook](https://github.com/ran-isenberg/aws-lambda-handler-cookbook), a serverless service template project.

The template project provides a working, deployable, open source-based, serverless service template with an AWS Lambda function and AWS CDK Python code with all the best practices and a complete CI/CD pipeline.

You can start your own service in three clicks.

### **Features**

- Python Serverless service with a recommended file structure.
- CDK infrastructure with infrastructure tests and security tests.
- Both synchronous and asynchronous resources
- CI/CD pipelines based on Github actions that deploys to AWS with python linters, complexity checks and style formatters.
- CI/CD pipeline deploys to dev/staging and production environment with different gates between each environment
- Makefile for simple developer experience.
- The AWS Lambda handler embodies Serverless best practices and has all the bells and whistles for a proper production ready handler.
- AWS Lambda handler uses [AWS Lambda Powertools](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-python/): logger, tracer, metrics, event handler, validation, batch
- AWS Lambda handler three layer architecture: handler layer, logic layer and data access layer (integration)
- Cognito user pool with a test user. All E2E tests automatically login with the test user and use a JWT id token
- Idempotent API
- Authentication protected API
- REST API protected by WAF with four AWS managed rules in production deployment
- CloudWatch dashboards - High level and low level including CloudWatch alarms
- Unit, infrastructure, security, integration and end to end tests.

While the code examples are written in Python, the principles are valid to any supported AWS Lambda handler programming language.
